# **AI-Powered Mood-Based Theme Switcher**  


## Description

This project is a React-based theme switcher that dynamically adjusts the UI theme based on the user’s selected mood. Users can pick a mood, and the interface updates accordingly to reflect the emotion visually. The project focuses on state management, component reusability, event handling, and conditional rendering.

This was developed as part of a challenge, ensuring clean and efficient implementation of core React concepts while maintaining a smooth user experience.  

  
## Implemented Features

- State Management: Uses useState to store and update the selected mood and theme.

- Props & Component Reusability: Utilizes a MoodThemeProvider to manage and update themes dynamically.

- Event Handling: Users can switch moods via interactive buttons.

- Conditional Rendering: Changes UI elements, colors, and typography based on the selected mood.

- Mood-Based Music Recommendation: Displays a relevant Spotify playlist for each mood.

- Surprise Me Button: Randomly selects a mood and applies its corresponding theme.

- Smooth Animations: Implements Framer Motion for UI transitions based on mood.

- Local Storage Support: Saves the last selected mood and theme for consistency.

- Responsive Design: Optimized layout for different screen sizes.

- GitHub Integration: Successfully pushed and documented the project for easy collaboration.

  
  

## Technologies Used

- React (JavaScript) – Core framework for building the interactive UI.

- Framer Motion – For smooth animations and transitions.

- CSS & Custom Styling – For visually appealing themes.

- Git & GitHub – Version control and project tracking.
  


## Future Enhancements (If Given More Time)

The project was developed within a limited timeframe, but here’s what I would add if given more time:

#### Short-Term Enhancements

- Spotify API Integration: Automatically fetch and display curated playlists.

- Independent Dark Mode Toggle: Separate from mood-based themes, for accessibility.

- Custom Mood Creator: Allow users to create and save their own mood-based themes.

- Mood-Based UI Sounds: Subtle sound effects based on mood selection.

#### Long-Term Enhancements

- AI-Generated Theme Suggestions: Use OpenAI API to suggest color palettes based on mood.

- Sentiment Analysis: Auto-select a mood based on user input.

- Performance Optimization: Minimize re-renders and improve efficiency.

## Reflection

This project provided valuable insights into state management, component reusability, and event handling. While I successfully implemented core features, I aimed to enhance the user experience with more dynamic UI elements and integrations. Given more time, I would focus on adding AI-powered personalization, animations, and additional interactivity.
